# blockchain-tutorial
Followed a tutorial I found online - https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46. I thought it was pretty interesting. It gave a basic overview of the major concepts of blockchain such as proof of work, consensus, mining, peer-to-peer networks. There are a lot of other features I will add eventually, such as validation, wallets, etc. Maybe even make it productionizeable, but I'm still a decent way off.
